Відповідь: Chorus:

Gonna get high on that frog's high,
Gonna take a trip down that Crazy toad's lie.
Time to jump off the world,
Time to get that croak-uh high.


Verse 1: 

Gonna get me a frog, gonna hit me a high,
Gonna get some of that Crazy Toad's thighs.
Gonna get it good gonna get it strong,
Gonna keep that fog away with the Crazy Toad's bombs.

Verse 2:

In the night I'ma make sure I'm toad free,
In the day I'ma take those drugs and make them last forever.
Gonna reach out and find who I want to be,
Gonna reach out and find who I need to be.

Chorus:

Gonna get high on that frog's high,
Gonna take a trip down that Crazy toad's lie.
Time to jump off the world,
Time to get that croak-uh high.

Verse 3: 

Living life in the green stream,
There's not much else that's cooler than this.
Feeling Crazy, feeling wild,
Doing bad and doing things I can't deny.

Chorus: 

Gonna get high on that frog's high,
Gonna take a trip down that Crazy toad's lie.
Time to jump off the world,
Time to get that croak-uh high.
