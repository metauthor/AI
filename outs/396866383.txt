Ваше питання: Why electric resistivity in graphite decrease with increasing of the electric current density?

Відповідь: The decrease in electric resistivity with increasing electric current density in graphite is due to the increased contribution of the more easily mobile electrons in the conduction process. This effect becomes more pronounced in low temperatures, when the lattice vibrations are reduced and the electrons become more mobile. The current will conduct more easily along the plane of the graphite lattice. The more easily mobile electrons are able to move more easily through the lattice when a larger electric current is induced, resulting in a decrease in electric resistivity.
