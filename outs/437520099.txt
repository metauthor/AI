3. Design an App: In this step, you need to plan out the design of your app. You must decide how it will look, the user interface, and the user experience. 

4. Develop: Once the design is complete, you need to start coding your app. You need to use the Xcode IDE to build your app, use the Swift language to write the code and utilize the iOS frameworks to construct the user interface. 

5. Test and Debug: Testing and debugging an app is one of the most important steps in developing an app. You need to ensure that your app is free of any bugs and that it works as expected in all supported devices. 

6. Publish: Once you have tested and debugged your app, you can go ahead and upload it to the App Store. You need to provide all the necessary information about your app in order to get approved by Apple.
