Ваше питання: brutal Biden

Відповідь: win

If Biden wins the election in November, he will take office in January of 2021 and face a number of significant challenges. He will need to immediately address the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, stand up against the radicalization of the Republican Party, and work to improve relations between the US and other countries around the world. Additionally, he must prioritize appointing experienced judges and establishing progressive legislation to fight income inequality and racial injustice. Biden’s rhetoric speaks to a more unified, compassionate, and inclusive country, and this is the goal he should pursue heading into the brutal year of 2021.
