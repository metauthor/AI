Відповідь: My love, on Valentine's Day, there's something I want to say 
Let's share how endless and deep our love really is today

You're the one that stands besides me, the one who cares and listens
You inspire my whole being with all of your actions

Your softness brings forth peace, you're such a delight
From talks of nature and landscapes, to airing our flights

Your words shaped of beauty can make me swoon
Your writing comes natural, shiningly and true

My love, thank our hearts for all your musings, fastening,
each day that passes our love is evermaxing

And as we thrive through these moments, our feelings will pour and we'll long,
I'm simply delighted to call you my love, for now and evermore
