Ваше питання: A message to a woman on the subject of knock-knock, can you tell me the way to your heart?  For 400 character

Відповідь: Knock, knock! Who's there? Love! Love who? Yes, love is absolutely the way to my heart. Love can come in many forms and the one that speaks to me may be different than someone else. For me, it’s the little things that make a big difference. When I’m feeling down, a simple hug or funny joke goes a long way. Even something as small as a meaningful thoughtful text or admiring look can make all the difference. All in all, when someone truly comes from a place of love, it doesn’t go unnoticed. Showing it through their words, actions, and intentions are the ultimate way to my heart!
