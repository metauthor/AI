Ваше питання: Напиши англійською мовою текст про екоцид в Україні через військові дії Росії

Відповідь: .

In Ukraine, the Russian military’s actions have caused a large-scale ecological disaster. The illegal use of landmines and munitions has destroyed forests, water supplies and led to soil contamination. In addition, chemical weapons have been used which have caused extreme radiation levels in some areas. The intense military activity in eastern Ukraine has caused an unprecedented increase in toxic emissions in the atmosphere which has led to air pollution and morbidity among civilians. This has resulted in the destruction of the eco-system in the region. There is a fear that these conditions will worsen in the long-term, potentially threatening the future of the region. It is clear that urgent action needs to be taken to protect the environment in Ukraine from further destruction and contamination.
