3. How can we measure the effectiveness of different learning techniques?
4. We are living in a world in which expectation and short-term success is valued more than a long-term purpose and meaningful progress. We often forget that progress is made through failure and experimentation. We are becoming a culture of people who are too scared to fail. Yet, failure is necessary for learning and discovery, and most importantly, growth. The same is true for experiments. We may be able to predict success, but without documenting and learning from our failed experiments, we will never truly understand the results of our successes. Experiments and attempts that failed can be just as important, if not more important, than their successful counterparts and should be documented, studied, and understood. We should embrace the risks and learn to understand why something went wrong and use this knowledge to our advantage. Documenting and studying failed experiments, just like successful ones, can help prepare us to tackle future, more complex challenges in the long run. 
5. Pointers in C++ are variables that store the memory address of another variable. A pointer is declared by specifying the type of data it will reference and its name. The advantage of pointers is that they allow programs to access and modify data stored in memory in more efficient way than normal variables. Pointers allow for dynamic memory allocation, which helps improve the speed of your program. Furthermore, pointers can also be used to refer to objects, which is another advantage of using pointers in C++.
