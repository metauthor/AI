Ваше питання: Describe in details climate in Ukraine in 50 years

Відповідь: In 50 years, Ukraine's climate is expected to become warmer and more humid. The average temperature is predicted to rise by 1.5 to 3.2 °C (2.7 to 5.8 °F) from the reference period of 1981-2010. With this increase, very warm summers will become more frequent and more sustained than previously, resulting in a likelihood of increased heat waves. Winters are projected to become significantly milder and wetter, while spring and fall might become drier and warmer. Heavy rainfall could occur more often, leading to increased flooding risks. 

The amount of precipitation is expected to increase in most of the country, with an increase between 10 and 15% in the east and in the Crimea, and up to 20% in the Carpathian Mountains. Due to the increase in temperature, the maximal snow cover duration is projected to decrease by up to 40% in some areas.

Average sea level is expected to rise of up to 75 cm in just 50 years, causing beaches to erode, storm surges to become stronger, and coastal lowlands being particularly at risk of flooding.

In conclusion, in 50 years Ukraine's climate will become significantly warmer, more humid and wetter. Extreme heat waves, floods, and coastal erosion will become more frequent.
