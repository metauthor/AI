Ваше питання: Hi! Can you help me with lyrics for song

Відповідь: Verse 1:
I'm searching for the right words to say,
My heart is aching and I'm feeling out of place,
I'm trying to make sense of my life,
But the world seems so out of my reach.

Chorus:
Oh, can I find a way to make it all alright,
Can I find a way to keep the dark from tonight?
I'm reaching out for a light in a sea of doubt,
Can I find a way to carry on?

Verse 2:
Seems like I'm stuck in a never-ending flow,
No matter which way I turn there's no place to go,
I don't know what's the truth, but I won't give up,
Cause in my soul, I know the answer's still there.

Chorus:
Oh, can I find a way to make it all alright,
Can I find a way to keep the dark from tonight?
I'm reaching out for a light in a sea of doubt,
Can I find a way to carry on?

Bridge:
I can't find the strength to move on,
I feel so helpless and I'm lost,
But I refuse to stay here and let go,
Cause I know deep down I'll make it through.

Chorus:
Oh, can I find a way to make it all alright,
Can I find a way to keep the dark from tonight?
I'm reaching out for a light in a sea of doubt,
Can I find a way to carry on?
