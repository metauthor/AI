Ваше питання: Why did Russia attack Ukraine?

Відповідь: Russia attacked Ukraine in 2014 in response to the revolution in Kiev that led to the overthrow of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia was determined to prevent the new pro-Western Ukrainian government from consolidating its power and aligning firmly with the West. The Russian government put forth several justifications for its intervention, including concerns about the linguistic and political rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine, worries about the security of its Black Sea naval base in Crimea, and an effort to reassert Russian influence in its immediate neighborhood.
