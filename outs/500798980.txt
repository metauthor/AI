Відповідь: English punctuation is used to indicate structure and meaning in written English. It consists of a variety of symbols including full stops (.), commas (,), question marks (?), exclamation marks (!), colons (:) and semicolons (;). Furthermore, parentheses ( ) and hyphens (—) are used in some cases.

Full stop: is a punctuation mark that is used at the end of a declarative sentence, or after abbreviations or initials. 

Comma: is used to signal an interruption to the flow of written language and allow for a pause. It is used to separate items in a list, separate clauses, or to signal direct speech within a sentence. 

Question mark: is used to signal a direct question. It is placed at the end of a sentence. 

Exclamation mark: is used to indicate strong emotion and surprise. It is placed at the end of a sentence. 

Colon: is used to introduce a list of items or a quotation. It can also be used after some clauses to introduce a phrase or clause that explains or amplifies what has been said. 

Semicolon: is used to join two independent clauses in a sentence and to separate items in a list when they already contain commas.

Parentheses: are generally used to include extra information or qualifying statements within a sentence. 

Hyphens: are used to join two words together to form a compound noun or an adjective. They can also be used to indicate a range of numbers. 

It is important to understand the correct use of punctuation marks as they help the reader to identify the proper meaning of a text and can greatly improve the clarity of written expression.
