+Configure Monkeyrunner
+
+Monkeyrunner can be configured using a number of options available in its monkeyrunner.properties file. This file is located in the directory where Monkeyrunner was installed and is edited using a text editor. The options available in this file include the default timeout setting, the default monkey types, the default logging level, the log file location, and the host port.

To configure Monkeyrunner, open the monkeyrunner.properties file and set the desired options. For example, to set the default timeout to 30 seconds, the logging level to Verbose, and the log file location to a custom directory, the following entries should be added to the file: 

monkey.timeout=30
monkey.log.level=verbose
monkey.log.file=../mylogs/mylog.log 

After you save the changes to the file, Monkeyrunner should be configured as desired.
