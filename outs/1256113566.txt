Ваше питання: Make Python code for economic strategy

Відповідь: #Create demand supply equilibrium
supply = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
demand = [50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0]

#Calculate the equilibrium price
equilibrium_total = 0
for i in range(len(supply)):
  equilibrium_total += supply[i] * demand[i]

equilibrium_price = equilibrium_total / sum(supply)
print ("Equilibrium price:", equilibrium_price)

#Create policy to incentivize demand
if equilibrium_price < 35.0:
  print ("Implement policies to incentivize demand, such as tax cuts, subsidies, and promotional activities")
elif equilibrium_price > 45.0:
  print ("Implement policies to decrease demand, such as taxes, regulations, and restrictions")
