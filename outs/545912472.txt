Ваше питання: What does „validity“ and „objectivity“ mean when it comes to scientific work? Please give an example on both. Write full explanation

Відповідь: Validity is the extent to which a research study accurately measures or assesses what it intends to measure or assess. It refers to the accuracy, truthfulness and appropriateness of the results generated from the research process. An example of validity in scientific work is the use of valid instruments to measure the data that the researchers are trying to obtain. For example, a study about student's self-esteem could use a valid psychological questionnaire to evaluate the extent to which self-esteem affects the student's academic performance. 

Objectivity is the extent to which a research study is conducted and evaluated without being influenced by biases, assumptions and preconceived notions. An example of objectivity in scientific research is a randomized clinical trial. Generally, objectivity requires that data be collected, analyzed and interpreted without personal bias or judgment so that the results can be trusted. Randomized clinical trials provide a neutral backdrop for researchers to study the effects of treatments and determine meaningful results without bias.
