Ваше питання: Freight Forwarding Process Overview. Can you describe it in details?

Відповідь: Freight forwarding is essentially the process of arranging for the transport of goods, whether within a single country or across international borders. Freight forwarders are essentially logistics specialists, who act as a third party between the shipper of goods (the seller or manufacturer) and the end-customer. In this capacity they arrange customs clearance, select the appropriate mode of transport, and make arrangements to ensure that the goods arrive safely at their final destination on time. 

The freight forwarding process generally starts by the freight forwarder discussing the particulars of the shipment with the customer and assessing their particular needs. They will consider factors such as the size, weight, value, and type of goods being shipped. After reviewing the customer’s requirements, the forwarder will decide the most cost-effective and efficient way to move the shipment, based on the customer’s defined route, budget, and time restraints.

Once the route is determined, the freight forwarder will then arrange the transportation of the goods through a variety of methods, such as trucking, rail, ocean, and air. The freight forwarder is responsible for obtaining certifications, securing contracts with carriers, ensuring the route is legal, and ensuring the proper tariffs and taxes are paid. They are also in charge of booking space on buses, trains, and planes, and in ports for the shipment.

In addition to the transportation of goods, the freight forwarder can also arrange for storage and warehousing services. This may include tasks such as packing and palletizing, hazardous material storage, and climate-controlled storage.

Finally, the freight forwarder will provide tracking and reporting services for their customers, including progress of the shipment, delivery and arrival notifications, and status updates. This can be done through online tracking portals, which allow customers to monitor the progress of their shipment in real-time. The freight forwarder will also provide value-added customer service, such as answering customer inquiries, providing order entry and data entry assistance, and providing invoicing, consolidation, and customer order management.
