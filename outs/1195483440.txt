Відповідь: C_2\cos(2\theta) \end{align}

On the unit circle, this simplifies to \begin{align} f(\theta) &= 2C_1\cos(\theta) + 2C_2\cos(2\theta) \\ &= \operatorname{Re}\left[2C_1e^{i\theta} + 2C_2e^{2i\theta}\right]. \end{align}

Now the problem becomes one of writing the series in terms of its coefficients.

A convenient approach is to differentiate twice with respect to \theta, obtaining \begin{align} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} &= -2C_1\sin(\theta) + 4C_2\sin(2\theta) \\ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \theta^2} &= -2C_1\cos(\theta) + 8C_2\cos(2\theta). \end{align}

The last two equations can be written as a linear system \begin{align} \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta) & \cos(2\theta) \\ \sin(\theta) & \sin(2\theta) \end{pmatrix} \binom{C_1}{C_2} &= \binom{- \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}}{\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \theta^2}} \end{align}

already making it clear that the coefficients can be solved in terms the function values and their derivatives. The matrix on the left is a Vandermonde matrix, and its inverse can easily be derived as \begin{align} \binom{C_1}{C_2} &= \frac{1}{2\sin(\theta)}\begin{pmatrix} \sin(2\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\ -\cos(2\theta) & \cos(\theta) \end{pmatrix} \binom{- \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}}{\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \theta^2}}. \end{align}

Therefore, the two coefficients can be explicitly expressed in terms of the function values and their derivatives at a given point on the unit circle. In particular, the Fourier series can now be written as \begin{align} f(\theta) &= \frac{-\sin(2\theta)}{2\sin(\theta)} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\sin(\theta)}{2\sin(\theta)}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \theta^2} \\ &= \frac{1}{2\sin(\theta)} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(-\sin(2\theta) \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} + \sin(\theta)\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \theta^2} \right). \end{align}

In conclusion, the Fourier series of a function on the unit circle can be written in terms of its values and derivatives at a given point on the circle.
