Ваше питання: Explain what we could encounter on the edge of the universe.

Відповідь: The edge of the universe is an uninhabitable and unexplored region, as no known forms of technology have enabled travel beyond this point. Scientists theorize that at the very edge of the universe, space distorts, time stops, and matter vanishes from existence. As such, we are unable to truly comprehend what, if anything, lies beyond the universe's boundaries. In some theories, it is postulated that another universe or series of universes might exist beyond this point, although this is still speculation.
