Ваше питання: What are the pains of Ecommerce users when migrating from GA Universal to Google Analytics 4

Відповідь: ?

1. Different Metrics and Reports: The new Google Analytics 4 (GA4) has different metrics and reports compared to those available in Universal Analytics. This can be frustrating for users hoping to maintain the same data structure and reporting format as before.

2. Lack of Third-Party Support: A lot of third-party services and marketing automation platforms are not yet compatible with Google Analytics 4. Some may eventually provide enhanced compatibility with GA4, but the wait can be a pain.

3. Different Implementation: Migrating to Google Analytics 4 will require different implementation changes compared to Universal Analytics. This can require significant time and resources from the IT team to complete the migration.

4. User Interface Changes: Along with the backend data, Google Analytics 4 also has dramatically different user interface compared to Universal Analytics which could require a lot of familiarisation and possibly even more training for users.
