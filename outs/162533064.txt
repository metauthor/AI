Ваше питання: Create which will be provided in response to the letter, the text of which is shown below. In the letter indicate the counter offer, according to the calculations, which will be provided separately. The counter-offer should be justified by the fact that the average amount for 2018-2020 has been taken for the calculations, which is based on larger contract amounts, and hence higher profits.    The counter offer is based on the limited term of the contract, the limited amount of the contract of 180,000 euros, the increase in the level of costs for the maintenance of the store and personnel in the organization of sales. Also indicate that due to the war in Ukraine there is no guarantee that all the goods supplied under the contract will be sold by the end of the contract period.
Letter text:
Given we are reaching the end of this negociation with Boucheron, you may find below our proposal regarding Orsay fees.
 
As provided by the amendment of our engagement letter dated of May 4, 2021 (attached) :
 
 • a retainer of 5,000.00€ has be paid on May 18, 2021 ;
 • Orsay is entitled to the following success fee of 30% of all monies paid ;
 • if the relationship with Boucheron is to resume and/or a distribution agreement is entered into among Sadko and any brand that belongs to Kering Group, Orsay and Sadko to agree in due time on the range of the success fee.
 
Since December 31, 2020, we have recorded 370 hours of work, for a total fee of 123,900.00€ (also attached).
 
Considering that (i) the monthly margin realized by Sadko with Boucheron is of 7,130€ (see our summons), and that (ii) the new fixed term contract will be concluded for a duration of 18 months, we could apply the rate of success fee of 30% on your estimated margin, as follow :
 
7,130€ * 18 months = 128,340€ (Sadko’s margin on the duration of the new contract) ;
128,340€ * 30% = 38.502€ (Orsay’ success fee).
 
As you know, this dispute has been particularly time-consuming, due to the context in Ukraine, the conciliation procedure, our requests to embassies, etc.
 
Consequently, and taking into account the current situation in Ukraine and the origin of the case, we propose to fix the success fee to 35,000€, which is a very fair and friendly proposal.
 
If you are agree, we will invoice this amount and directly collect the sum of 15,000€, which will be paid by Boucheron. Thus the balance to be paid by Sadko would be : 20,000€ (excluding taxes).
 
We could agree on a payment schedule by Sadko.
 
Please confirm everything is fine on your side.

Відповідь: I appreciate your proposal of a success fee of 35,000 euros for the new contract of 18 months. However, I would like to suggest a counter-offer of 21,600 euros based on an average amount of 30,000 euros for each year of 2018-2020. This was an average taken from our previous agreements, which reflects a higher profit for both parties. Taking into consideration the limited term of the contract, the limited amount of the contract of 180,000 euros and the increase level of costs for the maintenance of the store and personnel in the organization of sales, this amount is more reasonable and reflective of our mutual benefit. 

Due to the current war in Ukraine, there is no guarantee that all the goods supplied under the contract will be sold before the end of the contract period. Therefore, this counter-offer takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the sales figures by the end of the contract. 

Please let me know what you think about this counter-offer and I am happy to discuss further.
