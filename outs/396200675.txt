Summary:Enable Intel microcode updates

Intel processors can be updated with recent microcode updates to patch certain
vulnerabilities. Many distributions include microcode updates in their packages
and provide ways to load them during boot, but they may not be enabled by 
default, leaving the machine open to attack.

To enable microcode updates, most distributions provide an init script or a
service that can be enabled in the system startup. For example, on Fedora and
Red Hat distributions, microcode updates are enabled by executing the command 
"systemctl enable microcode". This command adds microcode.sh startup script 
to "/etc/rc.d/rc/startup.d" which runs the microcode process during the 
initialization of the system. Note that enabling microcode updates can have a 
negative performance impact, so it should be done with caution.
