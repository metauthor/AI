Ваше питання: Describe. how D&D characters reveal a colossal ancient dragon skeleton frozen into ancient underground cave.

Відповідь: The characters may stumble across the ancient dragon skeleton while exploring the underground cave. Depending on their class abilities, they may be able to detect the presence of something unusually large and peculiarly old. They may also be able to assess the size and mass of the beast, perceiving how long it has been in the same place with their investigative senses. As they explore further, the characters will be able to make out the distinct shapes of enormous horns and bony ridges. When they come close, the characters will be able to see the range of colors, textures, and details that the dragon had while alive. The characters may be awed by the sight or feel threatened and wary, as the dragon was no doubt an ancient, dangerous creature. They may also notice some details, such as any weapons and armor that might have been embedded in its skeletal remains and the presence of any riders or passengers it might have had at one point.
