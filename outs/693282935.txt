Ваше питання: tell me about websites accessibility levels, what differences they have and which tools i can use for an accessibility audit

Відповідь: Websites accessibility levels indicate how easy it is for people with disabilities to navigate and interact with the website. A website's accessibility level determines the extent to which the website can be easily accessed and navigated by people who use assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to access the Internet. There are three levels of website accessibility: A, AA and AAA.

Level A accessibility only requires basic accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and descriptive alternative text for images.

Level AA requires a higher level of accessibility features, such as providing clear instructions and labels, having a high contrast mode, and offering options to modify colors or fonts.

Level AAA requires the highest level of accessibility features, such as a fully compliant web page layout and forms and providing descriptive titles or headings to identify the content of the page.

There are several tools you can use for an accessibility audit, such as Lighthouse, Axe, Chrome DevTools, WebAIM's WAVE, and Tenon.io. Each of these tools has its own set of specific functionalities and features. With these tools, you will be able to identify any accessibility issues, detect errors, and get recommendations to improve the accessibility level of your website.
