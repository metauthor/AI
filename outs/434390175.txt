Ваше питання: what is next js and how it's related to react

Відповідь: Next.js is a React-based framework for creating production-grade React applications that render on the server. It is used to build lightweight, performant, and scalable web applications. It is based on React components and provides an environment designed to enable the development of performant and scalable web apps. It makes it easy to create universal apps with abstraction over the details of the implementation. It also simplifies routing and makes it easier to use data-fetching solutions for shared data between views. With Next.js, developers are able to leverage React’s component-based approach to create isomorphic web apps that render on the server and the client.
