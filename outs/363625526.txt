Ваше питання: Explain how this code works:
#!/bin/bash
DATE="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
FILE="/path/to/index.html"
sed -i -E 's/<meta name=\"date\" content=\"[0-9\-]+\">/<meta name="date" content="$DATE">/g' "$FILE"

Відповідь: This piece of code uses the sed command to edit a file. Sed stands for 'stream editor', which means it is used to edit data on-the-fly. The command here has two options, "-i" and "-E". The option "-i" signifies an in-place edit so the content is being edited directly on the disk. The -E option stands for extended regular expression, which is used to indicate that the commands in the table will be using extended regular expressions as opposed to basic regular expressions.

Within the command, the content being edited is the line that contains the tag <meta name="date" content="$DATE"> in the file located at /path/to/index.html. This line includes the variable $DATE which first is set to the current date. So what the command is doing is replacing the content within that meta tag with the constant specified by the variable $DATE, which is the current date. Therefore, what this command does is always update the date in the file located at /path/to/index.html with the current date whenever it is run.
