Ваше питання: How AI technology can use crypto tokens?

Відповідь: AI technology can use crypto tokens to securely and privately store data related to cryptocurrency transactions, including funds that are being transacted. Crypto tokens can also be used to facilitate transactions between machines on a distributed ledger—automating the process of approving, confirming, and completing transactions using smart contracts. Finally, AI technology can use crypto tokens to provide access to proprietary data sets and data marketplaces, allowing users to buy and sell data without the need of a middleman.
