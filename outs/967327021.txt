Відповідь: One day, Emily saw one of her close friends crying in the park. Sitting down beside her, Emily asked what was wrong and suddenly, her friend blurted out everything she had kept bottled up inside.

Emily opened up her heart and lent an ear to her friend, understanding her situation and consoling her as best as she could. After voicing her worries aloud, her friend felt much more at ease and the two began to talk heart-to-heart.

Her friend mentioned that she was concerned about failing an upcoming exam and Emily, being an old hand in the subject, told her not to get cold feet and to start studying immediately. She even offered to give her a hand if she needed it.

They started to study algorithm together, although Emily found it hard to explain the concepts due to her friend always fumbling around and being all fingers and thumbs. She had to teach her and re-explain the same topics over and over again but soon enough, her friend started to understand.

However, after studying for weeks, her friend seemed to lose confidence and wanted to give up. Seeing her so discouraged made Emily out of her mind. She was heart broken, feeling like all her hard work had gone to waste.

It was then that Emily knew it was time to sit her friend down and to face the facts. She told her friend that she needed to put on a brave face no matter what the outcome would be and advised her to try her best.

At the end of their conversation, Emily's friend felt more hopeful and the two hugged goodbye. Suddenly it entered Emily's head that even though the results of the exam was still uncertain, her friend was in safe hands now.
