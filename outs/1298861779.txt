Відповідь: Once upon a time, there was an intelligent scientist from Mariupol who was very fond of computers. He had the idea of creating the most powerful laptop in the world. To achieve this ambition, he started looking for special components. He found a processor of the latest generation, the keys of different colors, and the most powerful microprocessor ever. He also gathered a great team of wizards to construct the laptop.

The scientist used all the latest technologies to create the laptop. He put inside it a powerful processor, a miniaturized microprocessor, and the best memory – all of them in a tiny package that was still lighter than a laptop’s normal weight.

When the laptop was finished and tested, the scientist noticed that it was able to do things beyond his expectations. He took it to a party where everyone could use it and see its amazing powers. Everyone was amazed at the laptop’s speed and its features. Then, the scientist took the laptop to his lab and made some changes.

This time, the laptop was able to do something even crazier – he granted it the power to do magic. With a wizard’s spell, computer could make things appear or disappear at will. This caused a huge sensation in the lab, and everyone began to talk about the “magical laptop”.

Soon, the scientist was able to make the laptop even more powerful, giving it the power to access any computer in the world by using a wizard’s magic spell. With this new feature, he started to transfer an entire world of knowledge and understanding to his laboratory.

The laptop became very famous, and soon every student and professor in Mariupol knew about it. Everyone wanted to buy one, but the scientist refused to sell them. Instead, he decided to give it away as a gift to the people of Mariupol who were so curious and full of life.

And they lived happily ever after.
