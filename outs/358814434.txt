Ваше питання: What should I learn Java or Python for backend developer to be sought after in Europe?

Відповідь: The answer to this question depends on two factors: 

1.Your experience and skillset.
2.The job market in Europe.

If you are starting out in web development and have some experience in programming, then learning either Java or Python can be a good place to start. Both languages are widely used in Europe and can be used for backend and full-stack development. Depending on the specific field you plan on working in, you may want to focus on a particular language - for example, if you’re interested in data science, you may want to focus on Python due to its extensive community and library support. If you’re interested in working for large companies, you may want to focus on Java since it is one of the most popular programming languages for enterprise applications. 

Ultimately, the choice of programming language should come down to personal preference and the specific language needs of the job you’re applying for. It’s important to do research into the job and industry you’re interested in to determine what language is best.
