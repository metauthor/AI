Ваше питання: What does the Bible say about the second coming of the Messiah?

Відповідь: The Bible mentions many signs that will point to the coming of the Messiah. In the New Testament, it is believed that Jesus Christ will return to usher in God's final judgment (Acts 1:11; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; Revelation 19:11–16)

The Bible states:

Matthew 24:30-31 - “Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.”

Revelation 1:7- “Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.”

1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 - “For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.”

These passages provide evidence of Jesus Christ's second coming and His ultimate reign of justice and peace.
