Ваше питання: На пиши мені на англійській мові текст про те , як я відвідував фестиваль булочок, з використанням Present Perfect і past simple

Відповідь: I recently attended a delicious festival dedicated to buns. Before going there, I got really excited; I've never been to something like that before. When I arrived, I was welcomed with an awesome spread of different branded buns and treats. I've tasted several different types of delicacies and enjoyed every one of them. I also met some lovely people at the event, who were more than happy to share stories and experiences they had while baking. The festival turned out to be a fantastic experience. I really enjoyed spending time amidst so many delicious treats and interesting people. I am definitely looking forward to attending more events like this.
