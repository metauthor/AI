Ваше питання: nest js rabbitmq microservice

Відповідь: Nest.js is an open-source framework designed to build efficient and scalable server-side applications. It is built upon TypeScript and Express.js, which makes it an ideal choice for creating robust, and secure microservices. With Nest.js, one can easily create applications using RabbitMQ which is a popular message broker and queueing technology. RabbitMQ is implemented using an AMQP protocol and can be used to build a microservice architecture in which the applications and services communicate through RabbitMQ. This allows the applications and services to communicate with each other without having the need for a central server. Nest.js can be used to build reliable and scalable microservices, with RabbitMQ as the message broker for communication between services.
