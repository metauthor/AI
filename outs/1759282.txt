Відповідь: Monolith: Monolith is an architectural concept where the entire software application runs as a single, large application. This usually involves creating a single codebase, integrating everything into one single unit, and then deploying it onto a single server. The advantage of this approach is that it is easier to create and manage, as it does not require different services to communicate with each other. The disadvantage is that if one service fails, the whole application is affected.

Microservices: Microservices is an approach to software development where a large application is broken down into its constituent services, each one focusing on a single task or feature. This allows for greater scalability and better resource management, since each service is independent, allowing the application to scale up or down easily. The advantage of this approach is that if one service fails, it affects only that service and not the whole application. The disadvantage is that the setup is more complex, with extra overhead related to managing and communicating between services.
