Ваше питання: I like my job, but I'm burned out, I have no desire to develop in it, but I really want to. You as a psychologist tell me how to deal with this?

Відповідь: Burnout is a common phenomenon, especially among individuals who are heavily invested in their work. Here are some steps you can take to cope with feelings of burnout:

1. Take regular breaks – Taking regular breaks away from work will help you stay energized and motivated. Spend time with family and friends or participating in activities that you enjoy doing.

2. Change tasks – Changing up your tasks will provide a new perspective on your job and help to reduce the feeling of burn out.

3. Ask for help – Don’t be afraid to ask for help from colleagues or your manager when you need it.

4. Establish boundaries – Establish boundaries about when it is and isn’t appropriate for your work to interfere with your personal life. 

5. Find support – Find a support system such as a confidant, mentor, or counsellor to help you stay motivated and maintain your energy.

6. Develop a plan of action – Create a plan of action with tangible and achievable goals to help reignite your passion in the job and make measurable progress. 

7. Prioritise self-care – Make sure you’re routinely taking breaks, getting enough sleep, and eating properly. These all help keep your physical and mental health in check. 

Finally, if the burnout is becoming unbearable, it is important to consider changing jobs or consulting with a professional to discuss your options.
