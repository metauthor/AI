Ваше питання: Write an essay on "Am I a planner or a procrastinator?"

Відповідь: Am I a planner or a procrastinator? This is a question I have asked myself many times throughout my life. On one hand, I can recognize that I am more of a procrastinator who loves waiting until the last possible minute to do an assignment, but on the other hand, I can also see that I take considerable time to plan out tasks, giving myself plenty of time to complete them.

At an early age, I remember always pushing tasks back due to being easily distracted and unable to focus for long periods of time. I would always end up waiting until the last minute to complete the assignment, leaving me without any time to review it or make corrections and causing me to stay up very late. To this day, I still find it hard to focus on long-term tasks and occasionally struggle to stay motivated to finish what I start.

It wasn’t until I finished my college career that I made an effort to become a more organized individual. I enrolled in a productivity course and developed routines in my day-to-day life that began to help me manage my time more efficiently and stay focused for longer periods of time. As a result of this, I now spend a considerable amount of time writing out plans to help me keep track of my tasks and goals.

After taking a closer look, I now realize that I am in fact both a planner and a procrastinator. While I can be quick to procrastinate if given the opportunity, I’ve also committed to long-term planning and have been successful at taking the steps I need to achieve my goals. In order to make sure I achieve my goals and become a more productive individual, I now have to focus on tackling tasks as soon as possible and make sure that I give myself enough time to review them before the due date.
