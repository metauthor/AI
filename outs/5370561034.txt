Ваше питання: In the laboratory, during the reaction of butanal with hydrocyanic acid, cyanohydrin was obtained.  Specify the type and mechanism of the reaction: СН3- СН2- СН2- СОН + HCN:

Відповідь: This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, wherein the nucleophile (hydrocyanic acid) adds to the electrophilic carbon of the aldehyde group of butanal to form a symmetrical cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack, proton transfer, and elimination steps. 

Nucleophilic attack: HCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of the aldehyde group of butanal.

Proton transfer: Proton transfer occurs from HCN to the oxygen atom, forming a cyanide ion and a hydroxyl group.

Elimination: The hydroxyl group and the cyanide ion leave and form a new carbon-carbon bond, with the previous carbonyl group forming the cyanohydrin product.
