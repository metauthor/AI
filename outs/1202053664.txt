Ваше питання: Find information about the life and work of Igor Pavlyuk

Відповідь: Igor Pavlyuk (1974-2011) was a Russian investigative journalist who reported on abuses in his home country of Russia and also in other parts of the world. Pavlyuk focused on topics such as the Second Chechen War and the murders of journalists. He was a reporter for Novaya Gazeta, a progressive newspaper in Moscow, and later became a correspondent for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

Pavlyuk was hailed as “Russia’s bravest reporter”, a sentiment echoed by fellow journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who said, “for us, Igor Pavlyuk personified courage, honesty and dedication in his profession.” He was praised for his dedication to his work, his fearless attitude and his relentless pursuit of the truth. 

Pavlyuk was murdered in 2011 in Ukraine in the city of Dnipropetrovsk. His suspected killers are still at large in Russia. His murder is part of a broader pattern of violence and intimidation directed at journalists in Russia. Pavlyuk’s story highlights the ongoing struggle of journalists and activists to seek out and publicize the truth in countries with restrictive media climates. 

Pavlyuk’s legacy as a journalist and human rights defender lives on. In 2016, he posthumously received the Human Rights Prize from the City of Weimar. The Igor Pavlyuk Memorial Prize is awarded annually for investigative reporting.
