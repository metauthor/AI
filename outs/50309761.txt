Ваше питання: Our company does not pay salary for 2 month. And our CEO does not keep his promises. What is better choice for me, to stay and hope for salary payment or to leave the company and try to find a new job? There is a difficult situation on the market, a lot of companies cut their personnel, funding is stopped, so not good time to change the job. But, again, I am not paid here. So, what to do?
Also I am team leader. What should I recommend to my colleages?

Відповідь: In this difficult time of layoffs and cutbacks, it is up to you to determine what is best for your own personal financial situation. If you can afford to stay and wait for the salary payment, then this might be a good option to consider. On the other hand, if the salary arrears are putting you in a difficult financial situation, then it might be better to start looking for another job. 

As a team leader, your priority should be to look out for the best interests of your teammates. If they need financial support and assistance, it might be best to recommend them to look for other job opportunities or use services like unemployment insurance. You can also explore other options such as negotiating better terms with your employer, working part-time, or seeking temporary employment opportunities.
