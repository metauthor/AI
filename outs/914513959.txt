Відповідь: .

Dear Alex,

I understand that your friends have smartphones, but your parents say that you don't need one and that it is too expensive. It may be difficult to convince your parents to get you a smartphone, but there are some benefits that you should keep in mind. Firstly, having a smartphone can be a useful way to stay in contact with friends, allowing you to keep up to date on what is happening in their lives. Additionally, most smartphones are capable of so much more than just making calls and sending messages, they can also be used for educational purposes to help you with schoolwork. It's also worth considering that with a little research, you can find a good quality smartphone for a price that is suitable for your budget. 

Ultimately, the decision is up to your parents, but hopefully this information can help you reach a compromise. 

Sincerely,
[Your name]
