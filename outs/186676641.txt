Ваше питання: lesbian roommates

Відповідь: When it comes to sharing a home with a lesbian roommate, the most important thing to remember is to respect their privacy and their comfort level. Ask questions and get to know one another, but don’t push boundaries if they’re not comfortable sharing. Take the time to sit down and talk about ground rules and expectations, and ensure that you’re both on the same page. Finally, make sure to keep communication open, as living with someone can be difficult. Remember that your roommate is an individual, and should be treated with respect.
