3. Rely on Your Resources: It is important to recognize the resources available to help you adapt. Resources may include your team, external partners, mentors, etc. Rely on these resources to provide guidance and feedback as you adjust to new changes. 

4. Utilize a Trial and Error Approach: It’s okay to make mistakes and use a trial and error approach when adapting to changes. Don’t be afraid to take risks and explore different solutions until you find the approach that works best for you.

5. Seek Assistance: If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the changes that you have to adapt to, then don’t be afraid to ask for help. Seek assistance from your team, external partners or mentors in order to ensure that you are able to quickly and effectively adjust to the new situation.
