Відповідь: Loses Lawsuit Against AT&T Over $24 Million Bitcoin Theft

A Texas judge ruled against a cryptocurrency investor in a lawsuit against AT&T, who alleged that the company was liable for a massive bitcoin theft from his mobile phone in 2018.

The Claims

Michael Terpin, the plaintiff, first filed the lawsuit in August 2018 against AT&T and accused the company of "gross negligence" and "privacy violations" following the theft of nearly $24 million worth of cryptocurrency from his mobile phone. At the time, he alleged that AT&T had allowed hackers to access his SIM card and use it to steal his digital assets.

He claimed that AT&T had "provided his account information to a scammer without his authorization" and that the telecommunications giant had failed to protect his personal data and financial assets. He sought damages of $200 million in the suit, including $24 million in losses, punitive damages, and legal fees.

The Verdict

However, the judge in the case ruled against Terpin, finding that AT&T did not breach its contract with Terpin or have any fiduciary duty to him. The judge ruled that Terpin's accusations amounted to no more than negligence, which was insufficient to show that AT&T was liable for the losses.

The judge also noted that Terpin had failed to “produce clear proof of the alleged fraudulent activity that compromised his SIM card or AT&T’s alleged gross negligence” in the case. The ruling was a major setback for Terpin, who has stated that he will appeal the ruling.
