Відповідь: Necromancer Survival

95-299

The necromancer, stunned, looked around the chamber, trying to make sense of what he had been told. One of the many voices had said, "The necromancer's survival is an absolute key to victory... But how can I survive, when I have nothing to use? Nothing to fight with, nothing to defend myself from?"

Another voice answered him, this one with a more calming tone. "You are the necromancer in this new age of darkness, and you have all the power you need to survive. Your power has been dormant for too long, but your task is to awaken it and use it to survive. You must learn to use the shadows, control the spirits, and understand the darker powers at your disposal. You must also remember that enemies, both seen and unseen, will come against you. You must use all of your power to protect yourself and those around you.

The necromancer nodded, understanding all that he had heard and grasping the truth of the situation. He was no longer safe, not even in this realm of shadows. He must take up the mantle of a necromancer of power, a master of darkness, and use his newfound power to survive. And he must use his newfound power to help the world, for something dark and sinister had come for the world of the living, and the necromancer was the only one who could stand against it.

And so the necromancer studies, learning the dark arts and mastering the secrets of necromancy. He builds a following of loyal minions, gathering strength and allies from the shadows. He grows in power, his arsenal of spells and rituals getting bigger and more complex. With each passing day, he grows stronger and more formidable.

But his enemies remain and their numbers grow. Some have gathered their forces together and march against the necromancer, determined to break the shadow-realm and launch a full-scale assault. Others still work separately, using sinister magic and dark necromancy to stamp out any sign of the necromancer's success.

The necromancer is pushed to his limit on a daily basis and he stands firm. He knows that each day that passes brings him closer to victory, and he uses every ounce of power he has to survive and protect his followers. He is the necromancer, a survivalist of the darkest arts, and his mission is to save the world from a growing darkness.
