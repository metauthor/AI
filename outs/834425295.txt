Ваше питання: Sharingan

Відповідь: Sharingan is an advanced eye technique unique to the Uchiha Clan in the Naruto universe. It is characterized by two tomoe around the pupil in each eye, granting the user a heightened ability to perceive and predict the movements of their opponents and discern the truth in situations. The Sharingan can even cast genjutsu illusions through eye contact and copy techniques by merely seeing them performed. As it is the hallmark of the Uchiha pedigree, the Sharingan is seen as a symbol of great power and respect.
