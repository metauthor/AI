Відповідь: Roblox Studio Script Speed Boost is an incredibly useful script that speeds up your workflow as a Roblox developer. It gives you more control over the script’s running speed and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to execute a script. It also reduces the amount of memory and CPU power required to run a script, making it an essential tool for any Roblox developer. The script works by boosting your FPS (frames per second) for both the client and server, which makes the game run faster. It also increases the overall performance of the game by reducing lag and increasing the amount of data being transmitted over the network. With this script, you can now get the most out of your Roblox Studio experience!
