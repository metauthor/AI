Ваше питання: liquibase-core init container kubernetes

Відповідь: The Liquibase Core library cannot be used to initialize a Kubernetes container. Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Liquibase Core is a library for managing “database change” and its purpose is to “provide an automation framework for database schema migration and management” where a “database” is any collection of data that can be queried. Thus, it is not applicable for setting up a Kubernetes container. In order to set up a Kubernetes container, you will need to use the appropriate tools for container orchestration, such as kubectl or helm.
