Ваше питання: attendance and participation and the
8:45
emphasis is that
8:48
the students will participate
8:50
in the classroom
8:52
while
8:53
there is a classroom activity
8:55
going on
8:56
on a particular day
8:58
uh there is frequently group work
9:00
uh in all disciplines but i suppose uh
9:02
more in business
9:04
um and other class
9:06
sciences but also in the humanities
9:09
and and the social sciences
9:11
professors do
9:13
emphasize on group work among students
9:16
group projects they have to work as a
9:17
team
9:18
to finish a project
9:21
a project paper or even do the
9:23
presentation in my classes i always
9:25
assign group work both within the
9:27
classroom as well as outside
9:30
um
9:31
it's very important that a student who
9:34
is taking a class be punctual
9:36
uh lateness late arrival
9:39
uh is not
9:40
tolerated if you do a couple of times
9:43
the professor will point out and and
9:45
will be
9:47
um
9:47
will be
9:48
uh forced to
9:50
deduct some grade participation grade
9:52
and so on
9:53
um
9:55
but when you leave a classroom
9:57
you might want to inform the professor
9:59
beforehand that you have something
10:01
important that you need to attend to
10:03
and then you can quietly leave
10:05
but if you leave without letting the
10:07
professor know beforehand
10:09
once is okay but if you do it
10:12
more than once then you the professor
10:14
will notice
10:15
and we'll let you know why that's the
10:17
case and we'll ask for explanation
10:20
our next slide please
10:23
um in terms of
10:25
how an international student
10:28
fares
10:30
in the united states um i have my own
10:33
experience to share i came to the us uh
10:35
many years ago
10:37
over 30 years ago as a graduate student
10:40
from nepal
10:42
and i had studied in india and nepal and
10:44
when i first came
10:46
to the u.s
10:48
there were many novelties waiting for me
10:51
but there were also many shocks
10:53
waiting for me
10:55
so i came by myself
10:58
and i had to figure everything out on my
11:00
own and in those days uh as you know
11:03
uh there were there was no internet
11:05
there was no uh social media
11:07
um a computer system was just uh coming
11:10
up and fortunately for me
11:12
uh there were there was these big dos
11:15
computers
11:16
uh fluffy discs
11:18
that i was able to type so one of the
11:20
most important challenges i faced in my
11:22
first semester
11:24
uh is
11:25
that was that i had no experience of
11:28
typing anything
11:29
i didn't know how to type
11:31
and so
11:32
i would write everything in longhand i
11:35
bought a typewriter didn't work because
11:37
i was
11:38
too slow and too many mistakes happened
11:40
while typing fortunately there was a lab
11:42
somebody pointed out computer lab that
11:44
had just come up and that had word
11:46
processing
11:47
fundamentals and that really helped me
11:50
and i would type one paper for a whole
11:52
hour i mean one page a whole hour it
11:55
would take and it you know the first
11:57
semester was really really rough so i
11:59
would advise uh students coming from
12:02
um overseas
12:04
to the united
12:09
south st or or african countries where
12:12
there is no system of teaching students
12:14
typing in their high school
12:16
that they should learn typing even take
12:18
a course for a month or so before they
12:20
come to the us it will make their life
12:22
much easier
12:23
there is a first loneliness here um you
12:25
you stay by yourself
12:27
um and but but the thing is that you
12:29
know social media these days makes
12:31
things everything uh easy and so it's
12:34
always important to connect with people
12:37
make network make friends
12:39
and
12:40
and try to get out to the gym and there
12:43
are so many facilities
12:45
um
12:48
usually when people come from students
12:51
come from i came from
12:52
let's say nepal or india
12:56
my english was different at the time
12:58
i had not spoken english
13:01
as a language of daily activities
13:04
i had taught college
13:06
but even then it was difficult for me to
13:08

Відповідь: converse in it first of all and speaking
13:11
in public that was one of the biggest
13:13
challenge and what i did was that
13:17
i read a lot newspapers magazines and i
13:20
would imitate the sounds um
13:24
uh the uh
13:25
sentences the lexicon if you will and
13:28
try to repeat that so that's what i did
13:30
i would read things out loud i would
13:32
listen to people speaking
13:35
and
13:36
uh mimic it myself
13:38
as weird as it might sound but
13:41
i did that and it helped a lot and
13:44
today i consider myself undergraduate
13:48
proficient in english
13:50
um so i would
13:51
encourage you to do the same
13:53
read out loud listen to the people
13:56
that will really improve your language
13:59
skill and then
14:01
if you join a gym oh if you join a
14:04
book club or some kind of group where
14:07
people discuss books or they have
14:10
discussion
14:11
on a certain topic that will help you
14:14
because then you won't be so isolated
14:17
and so lonely and
14:19
you'll be able to uh
14:21
progress faster in the language
